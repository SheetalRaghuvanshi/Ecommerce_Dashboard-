Description:
In the Ecommerce Analysis Dashboard project, I leveraged Power BI to create a comprehensive and interactive tool for dissecting sales and profit metrics across different product categories and geographic regions. The dashboard is designed to provide quick insights into key performance indicators (KPIs) and sales trends.

1. Slicers:
   - Categories: Furniture, Office Supplies, Technology, Consumer, Corporate, Home Office
   - These slicers enable easy filtering, allowing users to focus on specific product categories, enhancing the granularity of analysis.

2. Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):
   - Sales Latest Year
   - Sales Past Year
   - Sales Growth vs Previous Year
   - Profit Latest Year
   - Profit Past Year
   - Profit Growth vs Previous Year
   - These KPIs provide a quick snapshot of the business performance, facilitating comparison and trend analysis.

3. Quarterly Bar and Line Charts:
   - Displaying sales and profit trends on a quarterly basis.
   - The bar charts offer a visual representation of performance for each quarter, while the line charts highlight the overall trend over time.

4. States with Highest All-Time Sales Bar Chart:
   - A visual representation of sales performance across different states, helping identify regions contributing significantly to the overall sales.

Achievements:
- Streamlined data visualization for enhanced decision-making.
- Improved accessibility to critical information through intuitive slicers.

  
- Identified and highlighted states with the highest all-time sales, enabling targeted marketing strategies.

Tools Used:
- Power BI for data manipulation, analysis, and dashboard creation.

This Ecommerce Analysis Dashboard not only provides a clear overview of sales and profit metrics but also empowers users to explore and analyze data dynamically, facilitating data-driven decision-making within the organization.
